# Introduction 
This repo contains all the work required by the DevOps team. We aim to apply the DevOps methodology standards which helps to  </br>
increase realibility, reduce development lifecycly time, and increase effeciency via automation.

# Getting Started
As opposed to different software projects, DevOps can not be a stand-alone project so all files here represnt automation scripts for doing certain tasks 
to deployment. Some scripts will even need to be located inside the other repos (especially dockerization)
